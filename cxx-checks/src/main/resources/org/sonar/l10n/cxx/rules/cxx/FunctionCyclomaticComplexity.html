<p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is measured by the number of
	(&amp;&amp;, ||) operators and (if, while, do-while, for, ?:, catch,
	 case, default) statements in the body of a function plus one for
	the function itself.</p>
<p>
  Complex functions are hard to test, maintain and understand.
  Consider breaking up complex functions into more manageable pieces
  that call each other.
<p>
  Large switch-case blocks are often the cause
  of extremely high cyclomatic complexity. In some cases this may actually
  be okay. However, watch out for the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SwitchStatementsSmell">
  Switch Statement Smell</a> where those blocks indicate a bad
  replacement for object-oriented design and proper use of polymorphism.
